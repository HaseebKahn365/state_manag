Startup:
We have the login screen with two tabs for student and teacher login.
they can use their id and password to login. Moreover, both have the options to register.
we use a Boolean to go to registration screen and based on the value of the Boolean if true we will register a student and if false we register a teacher.
during the registration we the student can be paid or free user. (selection using radio buttons)

Special feature: when asking for password we have password field and confirm password field make sure that they both share the common text editing controller so that the password is entered in both places automatically.
Login screen:
